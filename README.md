# DigitalWatermarking
Techniques were developed to protect the ownership
information of the digital content by watermarking on grey scale digital images integrating the concept of visual
cryptography and digital watermarking. The schemes are transform domain based schemes in which the
embedding of the watermark is done in FFT(Fractional Fourier Transform) domain. The method was developed
and analyzed for the performance metric such as capacity, robustness, security, and attacks using MATLAB.
